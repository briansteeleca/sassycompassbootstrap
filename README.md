# Starter Project for Sass/Compass/Bootstrap

This startup project is based on [Responsive CSS with Sass and Compass with Ray Villalobos](http://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/Responsive-CSS-Sass-Compass/140777-2.html).

I've added [bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) and a script.js starter file.

You can also customize which Bootstrap modules are included:

* Customize the Bootstrap JS modules by adding/removing them from the `/js/bootstrap` folder. 
* Customize the Bootstrap CSS modules by adding/removing the from the `/sass/bootstrap/_bootstrap-custom.scss` folder.
* Override Bootstrap variables in `/sass/bootstrap/_bootstrap-variables.scss`.

> Be warned, this is as of yet untested!
